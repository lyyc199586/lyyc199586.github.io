Hi! I am **Yangyuanchen Liu** (刘杨元琛), a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Systems Engineering at *Johns Hopkins University*, where I work under the mentorship of **Professor Somnath Ghosh**, a distinguished leader in computational mechanics and materials.

My research lies at the intersection of **computational mechanics**, with a particular focus on **phase-field for fracture**, **multiscale modeling**, and **model-based simulations**. I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Mechanics from *Duke University* in 2024, under the guidance of **Professor John Dolbow**. Prior to that, I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at *Shanghai Jiao Tong University* and my B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at *Jilin University*.
