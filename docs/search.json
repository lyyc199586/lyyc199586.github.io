    "text": "Hi! I am Yangyuanchen Liu, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Systems Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where I work under the mentorship of Professor Somnath Ghosh, a distinguished leader in computational mechanics and materials.\nMy research lies at the intersection of computational mechanics, with a particular focus on phase-field for fracture, multiscale modeling, and model-based simulations. I earned my Ph.D. in Computational Mechanics from Duke University in 2024, under the guidance of Professor John Dolbow. Prior to that, I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and my B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at Jilin University.\nView my CV: English, Chinese"
